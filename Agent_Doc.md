# Agent_Doc: Task List

My job is to write the documentation for this project in a very simple way.

## My Tasks:

1.  **Create a `README.md` file** in the main project folder. It should explain what is in each folder.
2.  **Create an `Assignment_Report.md` file** in the `Report/` folder.
3.  **The report must be simple:**
    -   Use easy-to-understand language.
    -   Explain what the models do.
    -   Show how to run them.
    -   Give one or two examples.
    -   No complicated words.
