# Agent_PM: Task List

My role is to manage the project and set up the workspace for the other agents.

## My Tasks:

1.  **Define the Folder Structure:** I will create a clean and organized folder structure to separate the two models and the final report. The structure will be:
    -   `USCS_Model/`
    -   `AASHTO_Model/`
    -   `Report/`

2.  **Create Directories:** I will execute the commands to create these empty directories.

3.  **Assign Tasks:** I will provide clear instructions for the other agents:
    -   **Agent_USCS:** You will create a file named `create_uscs_model.m` inside the `USCS_Model` directory. This script must only contain the logic for the USCS model.
    -   **Agent_AASHTO:** You will create a file named `create_aashto_model.m` inside the `AASHTO_Model` directory. This script must only contain the logic for the AASHTO model.
    -   **Agent_Doc:** You will create a file named `Assignment_Report.md` inside the `Report` directory and a `README.md` in the main project root. Your writing must be very simple and easy to understand.

Once the directories are created, my job is done, and the specialist agents can begin their work.
