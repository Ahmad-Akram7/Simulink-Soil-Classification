# Soil Classification Simulink Project

This project has two simple Simulink models to help with classifying soil.

## What's in the folders?

-   `USCS_Model/`: Contains the model and script for the USCS soil classification.
-   `AASHTO_Model/`: Contains the model and script for the AASHTO soil classification.
-   `Report/`: Contains the assignment report.
-   The other `.md` files are just notes from the agents who built the project.

## How to Use

1.  Open MATLAB.
2.  Navigate into the `USCS_Model` folder and run the `create_uscs_model` command to create the USCS model.
3.  Navigate into the `AASHTO_Model` folder and run the `create_aashto_model` command to create the AASHTO model.
4.  The `.slx` model files will be created in their respective folders for you to use.
