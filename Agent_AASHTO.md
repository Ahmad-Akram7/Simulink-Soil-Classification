# Agent_AASHTO: Task List

My task is to create the AASHTO soil classification model. I will follow the "beginner" style guide.

## My Tasks:

1.  **Create a MATLAB script** named `create_aashto_model.m` in the `AASHTO_Model/` folder.
2.  **The script will be simple:**
    -   No `try...catch` blocks.
    -   It will create a model named `AASHTO_Soil_Model.slx`.
    -   It will only contain the blocks necessary for the AASHTO classification.
    -   Inputs will be three simple `Constant` blocks.
    -   All blocks will be on the main diagram (no subsystems).
3.  **Write the script content** and save it to the correct location.
